### Government

It is a web page about resolutions of a city council, peoples related to the council, and city budget. A user can see a list of resolutions with very detailed information like voting, affected to budget, and people's responsibilities.

A motive was to try and compare similar technologies. There is a list of comparisons with a short description of what I would prefer - [link](https://petrzalka.info/government/). I wanted to create a web about used technologies and their alternatives, but I have never finished it - [link](https://petrzalka.info/government-page/).

The project used code analysis tools (
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=frido%3Asamosprava&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=frido%3Asamosprava), [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/796fdd58-d3cb-4e82-b8a9-7e8765e8b3d8)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-frido-government-master), 
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f7099cd093f6431eb759942b43f08dce)](https://www.codacy.com/app/frido/government?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=frido/government&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)
), CI/CD tools (
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/frido/government.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/frido/government), 
[buddy](https://buddy.works/)
), cloud application platforms ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home#), [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/)), loggers to simulate real commercial projects.

### Samosprava

The aim of this project was to provide a web-based management tool for data used by the Government page.

I used [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) as the development platform. The backend is built on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). The frontend is [Angular](https://angular.io/) application. Data were stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) provided by [mLab](https://mlab.com/). The application was deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home#).

**repository**: [samosprava](https://github.com/frido/samosprava)

### MvnRepo

Application indexes `pom.xml` files in mvn repositories (like [Maven Central Repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)) to allow users to search for java artifacts. The project was inspired by [mvnrepository](mvnrepository.com)


My motivation was to try (in that time new) technologies like [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [Angular-CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), java.util.concurrent package and so on. The application was running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home#).

I was experimenting to develop in cloud IDEs. My favorites were [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [Codenvy](https://codenvy.com/)

**repositories**:

**[mvnrepo-indexer](https://github.com/frido/mvnrepo-indexer)**: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) crawler to download all `pom.xml` files from the repository.

**[mvnrepo-backend](https://github.com/frido/mvnrepo-backend)**: [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) provides REST-API backend.

**[mvnrepo-frontend](https://github.com/frido/mvnrepo-frontend)**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) web application simply displays search results of Java artifacts.
