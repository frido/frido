### Government

It is a web page about resolutions of a city council, peoples related to the council, and city budget. A user can see a list of resolutions with very detailed information like voting, affected to budget, and people's responsibilities.

A motive was to try and compare similar technologies. There is a list of comparisons with a short description of what I would prefer - [link](https://petrzalka.info/government/). I wanted to create a web about used technologies and their alternatives, but I have never finished it - [link](https://petrzalka.info/government-page/).

Project use code analysis tool, CI/CD tools, cloud application platforms, loggers to simulate real commercial projects.

### Samosprava

The aim of this project was to provide a web-based management tool for data used by the Government page.

I used [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) as the development platform. The backend is built on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). The frontend is [Angular](https://angular.io/) application. Data were stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) provided by [mLab](https://mlab.com/). The application was deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home#).
